# School-exam-manager
The MySql schema only consists of three tables- students, marks, subjects.
I developed the backend and frontend for write operations only.
This is a very basic project and intended to enhance my understanding.
Every school teaches various subjects. You can add them in the database through a simple form.
Adding students is also similar. Then you can add marks for each subject the school supports and that too for each individual student.

Everything is self-explanatory.
